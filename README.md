## Description

The NoSQL Social Network API is a backend application designed for testing routes for a social networking platform. It will enable users to interact with the platform by making friends, sharing thoughts, and reacting to friends' thoughts. This API is built using Node.js and Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. It provides endpoints for various actions, including creating and updating users and thoughts, adding and removing friends, and managing reactions to thoughts. Mongoose and MongoDB are suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured data typically found in social networking applications.
